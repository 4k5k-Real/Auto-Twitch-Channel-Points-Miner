# Auto Twitch Channel Points Miner
This is a fork of the gottafaster236 project. It allows you to enter a streamer list in advance to be able to run the script, knows no interaction, on a server for example. 

A simple script that will watch a stream for you and earn the channel points.

It can wait for a streamer to go live (+_450 points_ when the stream starts),
it will automatically click the bonus button (_+50 points_),
and it will follow raids (_+250 points_).

To run it, you first have to:

1) [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2) Install the dependencies. Run this command in the command line:<br>
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`<br>
3) Open the file name `main.py` and enter your list of streamer in the line 30, read the comment.

Then you can run `main.py`
